# App Review Times

Fetches crowdsourced data from iOS and Mac developers twitter posts, storing
the data in a couchdb database.

We are collecting the data so it can be displayed in a [Dashboard](https://www.thedash.com/dashboard/ePLKrnQ1sO).

The data comes from iOS and Mac developers posting their app review times on twitter. This is the same data
that is displayed on appreviewtimes.com


### Usage
Store your twitter and and couch config info in config.json.
